# Travel Tracker - Corbin March

* __Corbin March__ (GitHub: [MarchCorbin](https://github.com/MarchCorbin))

## Brief Overview
This is a trip planning app that is both accessible by people who are travel enthusiasts as well as their travel agents. Agents and travelers have two seperate interfaces that allow them different priveleges. Both websites communicate and affect one another so that each user when logging in gets the most up to date information available.

As a user, after logging in they will be able to keep track of all their past, pending and upcoming trips. The user will also be able to plan for a new and upcoming trip and specify where they want to go, when and how many people they will bring along. The app will then instantly create an estimated cost for the user and send the planned trip off to the agent for further inspection.

 As an agent, one will be able to see what their gross total is for the entire year as well as an up to date list of all the travelers planning a new trip. An agent can approve or reject any of the pending trips and will then update on the users corresponding side. 
 
 This project is made off of a small boilerplate that has already set up a webpack for development. 
 
## Learning Goals
* Build on a preexisting webpack to gain a better understanding of server mechanics in development
* Having a PR partner ensures that organization is kept and GH is still being used efficiently for PR management and timeline tracking
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve, delete and manipulate data
* Use lighthouse app to ensure the following of best practices for accessibility
* Using Sass to slim down CSS code
* Employ Chai Spies to verify that your DOM manipulation is happening

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript, ES6
- SCSS / SASS
- Postman
- Webpack

## Systems/Practices
- GitHub project management
- PR Template
- GH Project Board
- TDD

## Challenges
* Producing the financial informartion for both the user and the agent was a challenge
* Updating the pictures and data after a user had manipulated it proved to be very time consuming
* Unfortunately I did not get to develop the search functionality for the project, this would be the first thing to be added on if given more time

## Wins 
* Gaining significant practice with fetch and post functions as well as learning the mechanics of postman
* Learning more about data and file structure when organizing databases from an API
* Learn the importance of not only planning of project timelines but also the structure in which data will be organized
